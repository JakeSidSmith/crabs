**Run multiple [crab](https://github.com/dabapps/crab) processes with a single command**

## Installation

Download the relevant release for your machine from the [GitHub releases](https://github.com/JakeSidSmith/crabs/releases).

First we need to make sure the file is executable e.g.

```shell
chmod +x ~/Downloads/crabs-macos
```

If you are using MacOS Catalina then you'll have to do a stupid thing before you can start using crabs.

Right click on the file you downloaded. Select "Open". A dialog will appear. Select "Open" again. You can then kill the terminal this opened.

Now just move it to somewhere on your path:

```shell
mv ~/Downloads/crabs-macos /usr/local/bin/crabs
```

## Usage

Run all processes for a project (including a crab router):

```shell
crabs
```

Exclude process(es):

```shell
crabs -x worker -x scheduler
```

Run specified process(es):

```shell
crabs router web watch-js
```

Note: specifying processes will ignore excluded processes so the following would still run the web process:

```shell
crabs web -x web
```

View help and usage info:

```shell
crabs --help
```

## Environment variables

Crabs uses the crab `PROC_FILE` environment variable to look for procfiles.

### Prerequisites

Ensure you are using NodeJS 12.

If you have [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) installed you can simply run the following inside the project directory (each time you work on the project):

```shell
nvm use
```

If you don't have the correct version install already this may prompt you to run (just once):

```
nvm install
```

### Install dependencies

```shell
npm ci
```

### Build the binaries

```shell
npm run dist
```

This will output several binaries into `./bin`.
